Checkstyle:

require uses brackets
all requires at the top of file (no gaps, apart from comment)
If no imports, have class "definition"? at top.

Class.method = method immedeately after "end" (no space) / lower in file (do we even want this style?)

blank line before -- when
space between -- and when
same for "then"
for "given", no blank line

all tests must be "given when then" format
If-statements must have brackets
Space between end of if Close bracket , and start of "then"
No space between if and open bracket

Method/Class/Test name style?

PMD: 

imports(requires) match var names

no globals declared (unless comment to say ok?)

No single-line "IF" statements

First life on test = local lu = require('luaunit')
Last line of test = if(not running_suite) then lu.LuaUnit.run() end

no "setmetatable" outside Object? (unless checked?)

flag unused local variables
auto-remove unused imports?

???
Automatic minimum test coverage check?
