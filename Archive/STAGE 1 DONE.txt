----------------------------- STAGE 1 -----------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal:

1. Working "blueprint editor", that can (apparently) change blueprints, and their entities in real time.
Can stop editing.
- add functionality to position, add vectors class, and interactions
- add unit testing? (stdlib uses busted. I like lua unit - looks like junit.)
- pretty printing? (for table)
- Allow multiple entities to be "selected" at once.
- add support for non-entity fields on blueprint, so we're not destroying data
-------------------------------------------------------------------
MVP Design Proposal:

&Being able to use your own blueprints to fill/paste on to blueprints (single item)
&Keep track of blueprint being edited (event? gui?)
&add entity to list for existing blueprint 
&Keyboard usage!!!
&Way to "stop editing" (disable most commands)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

DONE visualise/extract a blueprint (text) with existing / (almost) built commands (done)
DONE try updating a blueprint, by adding a valid item (done)
DONE try updating a blueprint, by an adding an item with invalid position (done) - result: adds item to blueprint. (looks weird/overlapping)
DONE try updating a blueprint, by an adding an item with invalid name (done) - result: unknown entity name "" exception
N/A can we place markers off-grid, if we can't place things colliding in some way?

DONE Read blueprint in hand (stack)
DONE Write to blueprint

DONE try opening blueprint inventory. (make code)
 defines.input_action.open_gui	
 defines.input_action.open_item
 WORKS!!!
 /c game.player.opened = game.player.cursor_stack
 or replace cursor stack with blueprint to edit

DONE my mod - trigger by hotkey
DONE "N" = take blueprint from cursor and select it for editing.

Keyboard:
DONE Place bp on BP = add @ 0,0? - use L/U/R/D to move by 0.5 in any direction -> update -> reopen
DONE Hotkey H?? Shift-N?? to add "basic" bp to BP?

DONE Player clicks "tick" = done editing? (clear which blueprint editing from memory) (message box?)

DONE "license"?

DONE minor inheritance

DONE (sort of)Two different "blueprint" classes/designations (lua blueprint & my one)?

DONE New blueprint added to pipette, and updates screen.

DONE Fix pointer to pipette -> actually holding a blueprint :/

DONE update docs

DONE CREATE MOD PORTAL SPACE

DONE ADD TO GITHUB

DONE Create forum Thread as "homepage" in Mod-under development

DONE Post to existing "blueprint editor" thread.
