Research selection, and collision boxes
Squeak through
Origins... etc.

LuaEntityPrototype.collision_box - check it out (and selection_box)
- Collision_box = start everything on the grid correctly, and change "increment" from 0.5 to 1
-- Detection if element is "on grid" when you start moving it. If not, move to grid first.
Collision box ceil should compensate for mods making them smaller, like "squeaak through"?
USe selection box??
"Origin" seems to be top left of entity?!?

Collision box -> grid:
    Odd side = -0.5
    Even side = 0

"origin" of item in middle of first block it's in???

tile_width
Type: Types/unsigned
Default: calculated by the collision box width rounded up.
Used to determine how the center of the entity should be positioned when building (unless the offgrid flag is specified). When the tile width is odd, the center will be in the center of the tile, when it is even, the center is on the tile transition.

tile_height
Type: Types/unsigned
Default: calculated by the collision box height rounded up. 

power poles = 0.7 gap (doable)


ADD correctly

Rotate individual oblong correctly.

Change default move to 1, shift move to 5?

Change anchor points to corners? rather than object centre?? Yeah, breaks grid.

Change anchor points to corners now fixed

Change anchor point to selection element fixed

change anchor points to centre points... I can't see the effect :/
    (try move everything off grid, then add something)
Odd side fine, even needs to be moved.

"on grid" separate concept to both entity, and bounding box? -> extract??
Property of "position"? ("on grid" -> 0.5s or 1s with 1 spacing?)
    Not really. Bounding box has a different behaviour (all directions)

Tile box extends bounding box (done)
Extract entity prototype stuff to back end(done)
replace grid related stuff in Entity Prototype with Grid class (done)

don't move stuff on to Tile box points, but "on grid" tile points. (sort of done)
